    Industry, group of productive enterprises or organizations that produce or supply goods, services, or
        sources of income. In economics, industries are generally classified as primary, secondary, tertiary, and
        quaternary; secondary industries are further classified as heavy and light.

        Primary industry
        This sector of a nation’s <span>economy includes</span> agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying, and the extraction
        of minerals. It may be divided into two categories: genetic industry, including the production of raw materials
        that may be increased by human intervention in the production process; and extractive industry, including the
        production of exhaustible raw materials that cannot be augmented through cultivation.

        What is the industrial production and capacity utilization report?
        The genetic industries include agriculture, forestry, and livestock management and fishing—all of which are
        subject to scientific and technological improvement of renewable resources. The extractive industries include
        the mining of mineral ores, the quarrying of stone, and the extraction of mineral fuels.
